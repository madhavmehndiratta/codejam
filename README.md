# We’re Introverts!

### We usually hear 
- Introverts don’t like to talk
- Introverts are shy
- Introverts always want to be alone
- Introverts are aloof nerds

### Let’s break these clichés
Usually, we find ourselves surrounded by people not interacting with each other. They can spend all day with us but won’t talk. These people are called introverts. They don’t have anything against extroverts but they just like enjoying their own company. This site is all about them. This site is the one stop for all introvert needs. A person here can anonymously write blogs, play games, and even listen to music with anyone around the world.
We're a team of 5 members (all introverts), thus the website.

#### This website accomplishes these goals
- To set up environment for introverts by introverts
- Introverts here get the chance to discover and create their community
- They get chance to know the perspective of other introverts in different parts of the world
- It maintains their privacy and they can simultaneously have fun
